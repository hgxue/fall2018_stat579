   My name: Nancy 
   I tell people I am a bioinformatician
   In the past few months I have attendeda international level bioinformatics conference and have been working on a shiny app and my other    research project. Three most important strategies/tools I use for organizing my work: creating subdirectories with proper names with      dates for ease of finding my files/scripts, creating proper documentation, and I organize my email list by creating a folder with to-do    list


Hello!
